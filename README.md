# Graphic-Animation-Interface
This project demonstrate my ability to create animated graphic interfaces in windows forms.
Shapes will be generated from the sccreen centr and get larger and larger till thez reach the boundary after that they will et reversed to the inside. The interface gives the user the ability to pick which shape to animate and how many times will this shape be animated and how fast the size change will be through time.
